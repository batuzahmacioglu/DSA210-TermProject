# Project Title: Home Advantage in UEFA Champions League (2000-2024)
________________________________________
## Motivation
Football fans often claim that home teams perform better. This project aims to test that idea by statistically analyzing UEFA Champions League matches from the 21st century (2000–2024). Since the Champions League features some of the best teams in the world, it provides an interesting setting to see whether home advantage still plays a significant role at the highest level of competition.

## Methodology
Data Collection
Gather publicly available data on UEFA Champions League matches from the 21st century (2000–2024).
Data Cleaning
Check for duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent team names, and make basic corrections if needed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summarize match outcomes (home wins, draws, away wins) and visualize general patterns using simple charts.
Statistical Testing
Conduct a hypothesis test to see if home teams win significantly more often than away teams.
Visualization
Create clear visuals and interpret what the results suggest about home advantage.
Reporting
Summarize findings, discuss possible reasons for the results, and note any limitations or future extensions.

## Expected Outcomes
I expect to find that home teams generally win more often than away teams in UEFA Champions League matches, confirming the presence of a home advantage in football. However, since the Champions League features some of the strongest teams in the world, the high level of competition might reduce the effect of home advantage compared to domestic leagues.
